# Replacement script for caffiene/amphetamine
# uses builtin shell command: caffeinate
# And custom terminal countdown timer for UI: https://github.com/antonmedv/countdown
# requires command 
# $ brew install countdown
#
# usage:
# $ cafe [n]
# where [n] is time in hours
#
# caffeinate should run in background while countdown runs
